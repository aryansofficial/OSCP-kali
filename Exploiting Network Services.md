### SMB

SMB - Server Message Block Protocol - is a client-server communication protocol used for sharing access to files, printers, serial ports and other resources on a network.

==Works for both linux and windows.==

Servers make file systems and other resources (printers, named pipes, APIs) available to clients on the network. Client computers may have their own hard disks, but they also want access to the shared file systems and printers on the servers.

==So basically this is sharing service.==

The SMB protocol is known as a response-request protocol, meaning that it transmits multiple messages between the client and server to establish a connection. Clients connect to servers using TCP/IP (actually NetBIOS over TCP/IP as specified in RFC1001 and RFC1002), NetBEUI or IPX/SPX.

Once they have established a connection, clients can then send commands (SMBs) to the server that allow them to access shares, open files, read and write files, and generally do all the sort of things that you want to do with a file system. However, in the case of SMB, these things are done over the network.

###### **What runs SMB?**

Microsoft Windows operating systems since Windows 95 have included client and server SMB protocol support. Samba, an open source server that supports the SMB protocol, was released for Unix systems.


##### Enumerating SMB

Typically, there are SMB share drives on a server that can be connected to and used to view or transfer files. SMB can often be a great starting point for an attacker looking to discover sensitive information â€” you'd be surprised what is sometimes included on these shares.  

**Port Scanning**

The first step of enumeration is to conduct a port scan, to find out as much information as you can about the services, applications, structure and operating system of the target machine.

**Enum4Linux**
There is newer version.
Enum4linux is a tool used to enumerate SMB shares on both Windows and Linux systems. It is basically a wrapper around the tools in the Samba package and makes it easy to quickly extract information from the target pertaining to SMB.

NOTE: there is a newer version enum4linux-ng python script
`sudo apt install enum4linux-ng` This is from kali repos.

```console

##### Time to Exploit
First how to connect to SMB shares

```
smbclient //server-name/share-name -U username
smbclient //192.168.1.100/shared -U myuser
-p [port] if smb is not running on 445
```

```
What would be the correct syntax to access an SMB share called "secret" as user "suit" on a machine with the IP 10.10.10.2 on the default port?

smbclient //10.10.10.2/secret -U suit -p 445
```

Based on the enum4linux scan result what will be our way of connecting to a share
```
IP: 10.10.183.244
User: dfrxnwbv (possible)
Share: profiles
Based on results we know it is also allowing anonymous access 
So,
aryan@aryan-Latitude-E7270:~$ smbclient //10.10.183.244/profiles -U anonymous
OR
aryan@aryan-Latitude-E7270:~$ smbclient //10.10.183.244/profiles -U ''

### Telnet

Telnet is an application protocol which allows you, with the use of a telnet client, to connect to and execute commands on a remote machine that's hosting a telnet server.  

The telnet client will establish a connection with the server. The client will then become a virtual terminal- allowing you to interact with the remote host.  

**Replacement**  

Telnet sends all messages in clear text and has no specific security mechanisms. Thus, in many applications and services, Telnet has been replaced by SSH in most implementations.  
Â   
****How does Telnet work?****

The user connects to the server by using the Telnet protocol, which means entering **"telnet"** into a command prompt. The user then executes commands on the server by using specific Telnet commands in the Telnet prompt. You can connect to a telnet server with the following syntax: **"telnet [ip]  [port]"**

How will u connect to 10.10.10.3 on port number 23

This is something else here we can see that in the service description "BACKDOOR" appears many times.
This is a telnet backdoor.

#### FTP
**What is FTP?**

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is, as the name suggests , a protocol used to allow remote transfer of files over a network. It uses a client-server model to do this, and- as we'll come on to later- relays commands and data in a very efficient way.  

****How does FTP work?****

A typical FTP session operates using two channels:

- a command (sometimes called the control) channel
- a data channel.

As their names imply, the command channel is used for transmitting commands as well as replies to those commands, while the data channel is used for transferring data.

FTP operates using a client-server protocol. The client initiates a connection with the server, the server validates whatever login credentials are provided and then opens the session.

While the session is open, the client may execute FTP commands on the server.  

**Active vs Passive**

The FTP server may support either Active or Passive connections, or both.Â 

- In an Active FTP connection, the client opens a port and listens. The server is required to actively connect to it.Â 
- In a Passive FTP connection, the server opens a port and listens (passively) and the client connects to it.Â 

This separation of command information and data into separate channels is a way of being able to send commands to the server without having to wait for the current data transfer to finish. If both channels were interlinked, you could only enter commands in between data transfers, which wouldn't be efficient for either large file transfers, or slow internet connections.

**More Details:**

You can find more details on the technical function, and implementation of, FTP on the Internet Engineering Task Force website: [https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc959.txt](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc959.txt). The IETF is one of a number of standards agencies, who define and regulate internet standards.

```
**Method**

We're going to be exploiting an anonymous FTP login, to see what files we can access- and if they contain any information that might allow us to pop a shell on the system. This is a common pathway in CTF challenges, and mimics a real-life careless implementation of FTP servers.

**Resources**

As we're going to be logging in to an FTP server, we will need to make sure an FTP client is installed on the system. There should be one installed by default on most Linux operating systems, such as Kali or Parrot OS. You can test if there is one by typing "ftp" into the console. If you're brought to a prompt that says: "ftp>", then you have a working FTP client on your system. If not, it's a simple matter of using "sudo apt install ftp" to install one.  

**Alternative Enumeration Methods**

It's worth notingÂ  that some vulnerable versions of in.ftpd and some other FTP server variants return different responses to the "cwd" command for home directories which exist and those that donâ€™t. This can be exploited because you can issue cwd commands before authentication, and if there's a home directory- there is more than likely a user account to go with it. While this bug is found mainly within legacy systems, it's worth knowing about, as a way to exploit FTP.  

This vulnerability is documented at: [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/20745](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/20745)Â 

  

Now we understand our toolbox, let's do this.

==Anonymous Login==
Great, now we know what type of FTP server we're dealing with we can check to see if we are able to login anonymously to the FTP server. We can do this using by typing "_ftp [IP]_" into the console, and entering "anonymous", and no password when prompted.
